3D Engine / Playground for learning stuff. Features its own "home-brewed" container types like vector, string, queue, etc... mostly because I hate relying on std:: since it makes me uncomfortable for some reason, I just prefer to have full control over how really essential datastructures like that work.

Naming Convention when logging: ```"[NAMESPACE(s):CLASS(|DEBUG/RELEASE IF ONLY APPLIES TO ONE)] message"```  

I use a fully left-handed coordinate system because I'm left-handed. A notable effect of this is that the cross product will make use of the left hand rule instead of the right hand rule.  

Warning: Super unstable, and constantly changing - your projects *will* break!  
***This is your final warning!***
