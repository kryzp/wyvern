3D Engine / Playground for learning stuff. Features it's own "home brewed" container types like vector, string, queue, etc... mostly because I hate relying on std:: since it makes me uncomfortable for some reason, I just prefer to have full control over how really essential datastructures like that work.

Naming Convention when logging: ```"[NAMESPACE(s):CLASS(|DEBUG/RELEASE IF ONLY APPLIES TO ONE)] message"```
